The rapid development of crypto currencies is going crazy. I hear about it everywhere, from the coffee shop where I enjoy my morning coffee every day to the company restaurant in lunch time, from Facebook feeds to Youtube ads. It'd just suddenly fulfilled my media walls after a night when BTC price increased like a mad horse.

I once day also stock several hours to validate exchange accounts, several days to read and read whatever documents I could obtained and several weeks to monitor coins prices minute by minute. I got some profits, some losses. I did research the security markets before, but it took some months and honestly, I did not learn much. One reason could be I was not in a investment environment, I am just an engineer. But several weeks in crypto trading brought me more, not only technical analysis but also trading and crowd psychology. I could see it directly from my colleagues.

Then I started to be boring. I'm an engineer, not a trader. Researching finance, technical analysis, statistic and psychology are awesome, but I'm always quite boring in applying them day by day, minute by minute to markets. I like it doing in automatic way. Fortunately, Bittrex had usable API to grab market data and book order. So it was making time.

First thing I must do was a library to wrap exchange's API to use fluently in my prefer programing language. The result is [here](https://github.com/hanhha/bittrex).

## What it can do:
- Grabbing market data including candle sticks, volume, base volume.
- Booking orders.
- Depositing, withdrawing.

## Programing language:
- Python 3+

Then I could do some interesting stuffs. Off course, an Auto Crypto Trading System was a fabulous idea.
